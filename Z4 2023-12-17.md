1. What do you think is better: conventional or alternative medicine? Explain
---
    * To be honest in me opinion, best anserw would be both. Because both sides have great solutions to many of our medical issues. Conventional is based on science, but alternative is based on experience and knowledge gathered by generations. Both sides can cause negative side effect and at this same time help you. Of course you need to think by yourself so if something has no grounding or cause too much side effects it may be better to hold off with using it.
2.  What is some financial advice you could give to university students like you?
---
    * Best way to save a buck or two is to cook at home. Eating out or deliver is costly because beside for ingredients you pay for service and few other things. Cooking is much simpler than you think! Basic toast and scrambled eggs are cheap, easy and fast to make.
3.  Narrate an event that changed your life in a positive or negative way?
    * One of the worst thing which had happened in my life was be waking up with tinnitus one day. Constant noise in my ear caused me many headache and issues in my life. After many years finally learnt to live with it, but it still causes me issues.
