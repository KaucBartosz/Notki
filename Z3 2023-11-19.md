T: Past Simple, Past Continues, konstrukcja "used to"

1. Past Simple and Continues
    - Past Continues używamy zazwyczaj gdy mówimy o czymś co zajęło więcej czasu, coś co zostało przerwane przez inną czynność, gdy mówimy o jakiejś konkretnej godzinie.
    - continues łączy się z "Always"

2. used to
    - używamy gdy mówimy o czymś co miało miejsce w przeszłości ale już nie jest aktualne
    - Nie możemy w niej określić dokładnego czasu, tylko ogólnikowo np. when I was young, when I was a student itp.
